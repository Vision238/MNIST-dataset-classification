# MNIST-dataset-classification
In this project, I have implemented two classifier models on MNIST dataset :- Logistic_regression and RandomForestClassifier . Here, I observeed that Logistic regression can classify image from MNIST dataset much beeter than RandomForestClassifier. Accuracy in case of Logistic Regression was found to be 92% while it was found to be just 9% for RandomForestClassifier.
